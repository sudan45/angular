## Overview

This guide explains how to synchronize your Logseq journal across devices using the Logseq mobile app, MGIT, and GitHub. This setup allows you to manage your journals seamlessly from both web and mobile environments.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Logseq Account**: Ensure you have a Logseq account and your journals are set up on the web.
2.  **GitHub Account**: Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
3.  **MGIT App**: Download and install MGIT on your mobile device.
4.  **Logseq Mobile App**: Download and install the Logseq app on your mobile device.
5.  **Git Setup on Web**: Configure your Logseq web version to push changes to a GitHub repository.

## Steps to Set Up Syncing

### 1\. **Setup Logseq on the Web**

1.  **Create or Open a Logseq Journal**:

    -   Go to [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) and create a new journal or open an existing one.
2.  **Connect Logseq to GitHub**:

    -   In Logseq, navigate to `Settings` > `Git`.
    -   Configure Git settings to connect to your GitHub repository. You'll need your repository URL and possibly an access token.
3.  **Push Initial Commit**:

    -   Push your current journal to the GitHub repository to ensure your journal is versioned and stored online.

### 2\. **Setup MGIT on Mobile**

1.  **Install MGIT**:

    -   Go to the Google Play Store (for Android) or App Store (for iOS) and install the MGIT app.
2.  **Configure MGIT**:

    -   Open MGIT and configure it to connect to your GitHub repository. Input your repository URL and authentication details as required.
    -   Clone your GitHub repository to download your journal files onto your mobile device.

### 3\. **Setup Logseq on Mobile**

1.  **Install Logseq Mobile App**:

    -   Download and install the Logseq mobile app from the Google Play Store (for Android) or App Store (for iOS).
2.  **Open and Sync Logseq Mobile App**:

    -   Open the Logseq mobile app. During the initial setup, you'll need to select the option to use an existing Logseq graph or create a new one.
    -   Choose to import or sync with the GitHub repository that contains your journal files.

### 4\. **Syncing Your Journal**

1.  **Sync with MGIT**:

    -   In MGIT, commit any changes made to your journal and push these changes back to GitHub.
    -   Ensure you regularly commit and push updates to keep your journal synchronized.
2.  **Sync with Logseq Mobile App**:

    -   Open the Logseq app on your mobile device. It should automatically sync with the latest changes from your GitHub repository.
    -   Make sure to pull the latest changes to get updates made on the web or other devices.
3.  **Syncing Back to Web**:

    -   On the Logseq web version, pull the latest changes from GitHub to ensure that updates made on the mobile app are reflected.

### 5\. **Routine Syncing**

1.  **Regular Updates**:

    -   Regularly commit and push changes from your mobile device using MGIT to keep your journal up to date.
    -   Ensure the Logseq mobile app is synced with GitHub to reflect any updates made on other devices.
2.  **Conflict Resolution**:

    -   Address potential conflicts that arise from simultaneous edits on multiple devices. Use Git's merge tools or resolve conflicts manually.

## Tips

-   **Backup Regularly**: Keep backups of your GitHub repository to prevent data loss.
-   **Check Sync Status**: Verify that sync operations are successful and that your changes are reflected across devices.
-   **Use Consistent Formats**: Ensure your journal format is consistent to avoid compatibility issues across different editors.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Authentication Issues**: Confirm GitHub credentials and ensure proper access permissions are set.
-   **Sync Errors**: Review error logs in MGIT and Logseq for details and solutions.
-   **File Conflicts**: Resolve conflicts using Git's merge tools or manually review conflicting changes.
